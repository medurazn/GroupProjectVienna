		<h3>Football (Soccer) <br /> in Vienna</h3>
		<img src="Sports%20Pics/soccer.jpg" alt="Stadium" height="168" width="299" />
		<hr />
		<p>Vienna has some of Austria's oldest and most successful football 
		clubs and, as the largest city, has a fierce cross-town rivalry between 
		the two main teams.</p>
		<p>In recent years however the dominance of the Vienna clubs has been 
		threatened by large-scale although sometimes temporary investment made 
		in teams in other parts of the country (e.g. Innsbruck, Salzburg and 
		Graz).</p>

	<p>
	Rapid Vienna get mentioned first for outraged Austria fans because they are 
	the oldest club and for the fact that they have a club website with an 
	English section.</p>
	<p>SK Rapid Wien were founded in the last year of the 19th century and are 
	known as the "Hütteldorfer" after the location of the stadium or 
	"Grün-Weiss" after their traditional green and white shirts.</p>
	<p>Rapid have been crowned champions of the Austrian League 32 times and 
	reached the European Cup-Winners' Cup final twice. They play at the 
	Gerhard-Hanappi Stadium in the western 14th District of Vienna.</p>

	<p>Austria Wien (strangely the Austria is Anglicised but the Vienna not) are 
	the great city rivals of Rapid.</p>
	<p>FK Austria Wien are known as the "Veilchen" - the Violets - after their 
	strip and have won the Austrian Championship 23 times and reached the final

	<p>They play, after a somewhat nomadic existence, in the Franz Horr Stadium 
	in the south of Vienna near the Sudosttangente motorway. Underground 
	station: Reumannplatz (this is a fair walk from the stadium but buses and 
	trams are available)</p>

	the first game at their current Hohe Warte ground there in that year.</p>
	<p>The club currently play in Austria's second division (as is the custom 
	nowadays confusingly named the Erste Liga - First League) after a spell in 
	the lower leagues. They are known as the "Döblinger" after the location of 
	the ground in the suburb of Döbling. The club have won the Austrian 
	championships six times.</p>
